#### Track your flights

Furaito is a simple app that checks your emails to find your last flights.
It uses [Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org/), [Import.io](https://import.io/) and [Gmail API](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/).
No data is stored. The processing is done directly in the browser.

Have a look to [my website](http://www.yrezgui.com/) or [blog](https://medium.com/@yrezgui).
